  üëã Hi there,

  Welcome on my profile,

  I'm passionated by programmation, and I like a lot to do some little projects to learn always more.
  I mainly use **__python__** üêç for my projects but I also use sometimes **__html__**, **__css__** or **__arduino__**.
  I'm very interrested by Computer vision and Machin learning.

  I will share here some of my personnal projects. You can ask me any question about them by openning a pull request. Any feedback would be very appreciated to help me to improve myself

  I also participate to the Ia-z and Franceia projects. [Here](https://github.com/ia-z/ia-z) is the repository of the Ia-z project. More informations about the France ia project on [Defend Intelligence community discord server](https://discord.gg/URt5a5dCTt).
